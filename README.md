# ProspectIQ — IDBI Innovate 2026

AI-powered lead intelligence for retail lending. Dual-score engine (Repayment
Capacity Score + Conversion Propensity Score) that identifies and explains
high-quality loan prospects — including customers traditional bureau-only
scoring misses (self-employed, gig workers, thin-file applicants).

**Problem Statement 2: Prospect Assist AI**

## Branch workflow

- `main` — stable, integration points only
- `dev-ml` — Dev A's working branch
- `dev-backend` — Dev B's working branch

Merge `dev-ml` → `main` and `dev-backend` → `main` at agreed checkpoints.
Never merge the two feature branches directly into each other.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GokulRavi777/ProspectIQ-AI.git
cd ProspectIQ-AI
git checkout dev-ml       # or dev-backend
```

Dev B can start building immediately against `ml/data/scored_leads.json`
and `ml/data/metrics.json` (dummy data matching the real schema) without
waiting for Dev A's models to be trained. Swap dummy → real output at
checkpoint 1.

## The one rule

Nobody edits `shared/lead_schema.json` alone. If a field needs to change,
message the other dev first — a silent schema change is the most common way
parallel work breaks at merge time.
